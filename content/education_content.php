                <p>Burger Builder is my first-ever project. It was the first project assigned to students in the coding bootcamp program I had taken. The project was required to be frontend only and was required to be a game. All functionality for the game had to be done through DOM Manipulation.</p>

                <p>The game placed players in the shoes of a chef where they are given one minute to build randomly picked orders from "customers". The burger must be built from the bottom up and sent for inspection. With every correct order, players will earn points and any wrong order will lose points.</p>

                <p>For my first-ever team project, my class was divided into pre-assigned teams of three. My teammates were Derek Foster and Booker Showers III. We had just finished learning about backend development and one of the main requirements was that a user could create an account on our app.</p>

                <p>The app was created from one of our program instructors who jokingly pitched the idea. We, as a team, wanted to turn his silly thought into a reality. The app allowed users to store the numbers of their favorite people and send them pre-generated text messages from a list. It was meant to help individuals send messages with all of the right words when they couldn't think of what to say.</p>

                        <p>In order for students to understand what a work environment in the real world was like, a collaboration project between a Software Engineer class and a UX Designer class was made for a 24-hour sprint. Teams consisted of 2 students from each class to make a 4 member group. My Software Engineering partner was Jane Cho.</p>

                        <p>The project was to have UX Designers come up with a prototype that Software Engineers had to replicate to the best of their abilities in the allotted time. In the pictures to the left, the prototype design created by the UX class is the first picture (shown on top), while the final version of the software engineer replica is the second (shown on bottom).</p>

                <p>Wrapping up the lessons on React, the 3rd project for the coding program allowed students to choose their teams. Students could choose between going solo, a duo team, or teaming up with 2 other students to create a final team of 3. I chose my teammates Brock Molmen and Lauren Nguyen. The project required students to use at least PostgreSQL, Express.js, React, and Node.js.</p>

                <p>The project we created was a tea informational app that allowed users to view many different types of teas, as well as see the benefits of each individual tea. Users were able to create a profile and save their favorite teas. A registered user could also save a specified benefit to only allow teas that fit those criteria to display in a search result.</p>

                <h4>December 17th, 2020</h4>

                <p>The final project for the program was a mandatory solo project. Students were given the liberty to create whatever they desired. The only catch was that the app had to have a frontend and backend to its code, as well as push the student's ability to code by themselves. If a student obviously did not put their skills to the test, then they would not receive a passing grade. My love for video games fueled my decision to make another game. I was not a strong backend developer so I took this opportunity to test myself by creating a game that required a lot of backend code.</p>

                <p>The game is based on the Korean pop group, BLACKPINK and is played as a fill-in-the-blank type of game. Players would be able to choose a song from the group's discography and will be faced with 10 questions. Players are then given blanks to type in the correct answer. After submitting their answers, the correct answers would be displayed with the player's guess.</p>
