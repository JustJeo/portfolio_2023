    <p>The 3rd website rebuild I was assigned was also from another acquisitioned company. This was the most recently created website compared to the two other rebuild projects I have worked on. I liked the blue and orange colors from the original website and decided to stick with it for the rebuild. I went for a sleek and simpler look, making sure not to take away from the content with constantly moving elements.</p>
