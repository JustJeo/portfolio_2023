        <p>Sircles is the up and coming competitor for Yelp. It was designed to only recommend places and businesses if your friend "loved" it. No comments needed. Sircles was also created by the CEO of Tech 2U. They needed my help to work on the website's frontend. This was the first one-page project that I've worked on. There were many looping lottie videos and responsive design that had to be taken into account as Sircles is a mobile-first application.</p>
