    <p>After acquisitioning this company, Tech 2U assigned me my 2nd rebuild project. The website was to be built with a more modern look as the last website was created in the early 2000's. The initial look was made sleeker and simpler while also having a lot of hover over features. I also added a looping animation on one of the pages to test the waters.</p>
