            <p>The CIO of Tech 2U created another company called FireUp Esports Lounge. Although they already have a main website, I was tasked to help build the frontend of their room reservation page. A booking system was created to help customers reserve a party package at the lounge. They would be able to choose their desired room, select how long they want to reserve the room, and for what date they wanted to reserve the room on. Included in a user's party package was the room they reserved, a private cabana, a gaming hex pod, and bar discounts.</p>
            
            <p>The booking system was built inside of a custom portal which then processes payments using Square. As customers fill out the forms for their reservation, boxes were given small animations and highlights whenever a selection was made. There are other portals on the page that open up an FAQ section and explain what the private cabana and gaming hex pods are. The thought of a majority of customers booking through their cell phones came to mind, which then had the Senior Web Developer task me with making sure the reservation page was mobile-friendly.</p>
