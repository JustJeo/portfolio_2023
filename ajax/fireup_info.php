    <p>The CIO of Tech 2U has created another company called FireUp Esports Lounge. Although they already have a main website, I was tasked to help build the frontend of the reservation page. A booking system was created inside of a modal made from scratch/ It animates and highlights whenever a user makes a selection so they know what it is they are selecting.</p>
