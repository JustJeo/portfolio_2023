                <p>This website was built for a client who specifically wanted a booking system built in. Once a customer submitted an appointment, the calendar would gray out the requested time so that another customer could not book at the same time.</p>
            
                <p>This website is in the last phase before going live to the public. The client recently welcomed his first child and has put the website on hold for now to be there for his family.</p>
