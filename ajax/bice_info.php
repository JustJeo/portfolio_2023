            <p>Bice Mobile Marine is a boat repair company where they come to you. This website was built for a client who specifically wanted a built-in booking system. He expressed how much he wanted to be able to show his customers what days he was available and what days could possibly have an all-day appointment. The client also wanted an appointment request form that would be easy to fill out and to email him when a form was submitted. Once a customer submitted an appointment request, the calendar would gray out the requested date and time to prevent another customer from trying to book the same space.</p>

            <p>Another feature the client wanted was an admin page. He wanted to be able to log in, view any appointment requests, and then approve, decline, or reschedule an appointment to better fit his schedule. If an appointment was accepted, the calendar would turn red for the other customers to know that he had a job booked that day. If an appointment was declined, the pending gray area would disappear. Any rescheduling done on his part would then move the blocked area to the newly scheduled time.</p>

            <p>This was the first time that I was assigned to oversee another employee for a project. My new co-worker and I broke the jobs down into our strengths while also trying out things we had never done before. He wanted to learn how to properly set up forms with Bootstrap and our Senior Web Developer wanted me to show him how to do media queries for responsiveness on all devices. I learned more about the calendar system and just how tricky it was to pinpoint dates and times. It was definitely a new experience, but I didn't mind stepping out of my comfort zone.</p>

            <p>This website is marked as "Completed" and in the last phase of approval by the client before going live to the public. However, the client recently welcomed his first child and has put the website on hold to be there for his family.</p>
