            <p>This is another website redesign requested by Tech 2U after the acquisition of this company. The overall layout of the original website was desired, but the photos and text were very outdated. In the original version of this project, the pages were packed with lots of information, yet presented in a messy manner. My co-worker and I had a lot of cleaning up to do.</p>

            <p>Once we set up the dev environment, we went over the original website and broke the work down between the two of us again. We decided to stick to the original colors of red, white, and blue. I, personally, liked the sectioning off of pages with the bold, red lines throughout the project. It felt very organized and spaced evenly throughout the pages.</p>

            <p>As we were building the website, my frontend co-worker and I were told to place a lot of the content into cards to give a more tidy and organized look. They wanted to have carousels in the cards on the "Retail" page to showcase the many products that the company sold. On other pages, some text color was kept red and blue from the original version. Since this was our 4th time working together, we were able to knock out this project quickly.</p>
