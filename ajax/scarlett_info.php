            <p>A mother, whose child recently defeated cancer, reached out to Tech 2U through a referral and asked if we could build them a simple website to unify individuals going through similar experiences. The website was built for a Tennessee-based organization that connected and helped families dealing with the struggles of cancer.</p>

            <p>I began to insert features that I had learned about and tested in my past projects. There were cards with photo carousels, accordions that introduced each member of the organization, and a form for people to volunteer at events they were planning on organizing. I also tested a timeline feature that they had used to map out the upcoming years and where they plan to be in the next 5 years.</p>
                
            <p>Although there was a lot of content on the website, some material had to be omitted due to the need of being planned, scheduled, and finalized. It was a very ambitious project, and though we weren't able to implement everything, the website was made completely for free.</p>
