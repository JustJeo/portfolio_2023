    <p>Not long after being hired at Tech 2U, the company asked me to redesign a website from another company that they had recently acquisitioned. They wanted my version of the website to look modern and welcoming while still displaying a lot of information to any visitors. Since this was going to be my very first website, the Senior Web Developer encouraged me to use this as a testing environment. He wanted me to familiarize myself with the company syntax, the Bootstrap libraries they use, and to try things I had never done before.</p>

    <p>As this was my first time setting up a live dev environment, I had to get used to porting over libraries, creating directories, and connect paths to the correct file. I used PHP to include sections and content into root files while using AJAX to set up a phpMailer for the contact form. As I was still very new to all of this, the Senior Web Developer worked on the functionality of the mailer. In one of my school projects, we had used a carousel, so I wanted to refresh my memory on how to implement that feature by using it on the landing page. I made a lot of references to documentations and to the original Laptops Plus website. I wanted to keep a lot of the original color schemes so I kept the logo blue and red while keeping the powder blue colors for text boxes, hover effects, and clickable links. I was also able to test out video backgrounds for sections and placing opacity overlays for easier reading.</p>
