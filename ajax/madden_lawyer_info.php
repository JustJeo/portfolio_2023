    <p>A client requested rush service for their brand new website. It was to debut at his company's grand opening event. My frontend co-worker and I had worked our butts off for the new few days to complete the website in time. We had implemented hand made "Read More" modals that would display in the middle of the website to learn the full story of each lawyer at the firm.</p>
