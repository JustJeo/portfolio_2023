    <p>The website creation for Bullard's Bar was my first ever client project. I was in charge of creating wireframes and all frontend responsibilities. The website consists of 6 main pages, many of which had multiple informational tabs that each contained image carousels. The landing page [pictured here] instantly loaded a video that would loop.</p>
