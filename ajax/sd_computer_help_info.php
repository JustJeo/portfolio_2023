            <p>This is the most recent and also the last assigned internal website redesign that I have worked on for Tech 2U as of January 2023. It's because I have cranked out so many redesigned websites for the company that I had caught up on their list of acquired businesses. Knowing this, it was very exciting. My frontend co-worker and I were ready to knock this project out since it would be our 5th project together. How different could it be compared to the others? Right?</p>

            <p>About half of the original website was asked to be kept. Our Senior Web Developer liked the colors along with the touch layout of the website. There was a request to make the pages more uniform as the last website didn't seem to have much consistency. As we were combing through the website, we were told that we would cut out some pages as they weren't needed. That was fine with us since we discovered a gigantic blog section of over 75 pages. We don't typically keep blog sections as they are usually severely outdated and talk about software that is no longer used at all.</p>

            <p>Halfway through the build, my frontend co-worker and I were told that this website had some of the best SEO results on the internet compared to a lot of the company's competitors. We were then told that if we did NOT include the blog section, the website's SEO results would completely fall to the point of not even appearing on some search engines. In short, it meant that we, most certainly, had to bring over all 75+ blog pages.</p>

            <p>It was a long and tedious journey, but after many hours of copying and pasting content from the old website into our code, we were able to tame the beast.</p>
