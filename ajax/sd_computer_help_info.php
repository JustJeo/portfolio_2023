            <p>This is the most recent acquisition redesign project that I have done for Tech 2U. It contains a gigantic blog section of 75+ pages that were all recreated for the redesign. The color scheme was asked to be kept from the previous website along with the layout for a majority of the project. There was a request to make the pages more uniform as the last website didn't seem to be made with such similarity.</p>
